# Stech Frontend Technical Challenge

Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to the frontend tech challenge. We'd like you to create a simple, responsive webpage that ingests data from an API and displays it in a useful format for potential users. You don't need to worry about design or layout, as we've provided mockups that you should try to replicate (as closely as possible).

# TODO

- Add a modal for when the API call is failing
- Refactor the code using Typescript
